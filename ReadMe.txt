Limit automatically blog posts in Archive / Home sections, without NoFollow, even styling your references with CSS.


== Description ==

Auto Limit Posts lets you cut down your posts automatically in Home, Categories, Archive and Search sections, without having to provide the necessary WordPress tag each time you compose a post.

The plugin lets you format the reference link. You can decide the text that sends your visitors to the full text of your post, use CSS directions from inside the admin section of your blog and / or in your main style sheet to have or not link decoration or border, change color, increase letter spacing, etc. Most of the default options should prove satisfactory enough, so that you won't have much to change.

Auto Limit Posts will **not** include the *rel=nofollow* tag in the reference links to the full-text versions of your posts. Although not certain, NoFollow may have a negative impact upon the popularity of a page, and I don't see why a blog should give a NoFollow direction concerning its main page addresses.

The plugin improves wp limit posts automatically. You can cut a post after an exact number of letters, or at the end of a word that is close to that number of letters, or at the end of the first paragraph. HTML tags you may have in your post (for images, links, etc) can be stripped automatically to prevent the braking of your page. Shortcodes too can be automatically removed.

You can see live how the plugin works (in this case limiting by word) at the site of [Desktop Gadgets](http://windowslivegadgets.com/gallery/) where it is used to link home / archive excerpts to screenshots and downloads included in the main page / full text of each post.
