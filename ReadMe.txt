Limit automatically your blog posts in Archive / Home sections (without NoFollow) even styling your references with CSS.


== Description ==

[Auto Limit Posts](http://www.thefreewindows.com/16305/download-auto-limit-posts-free-wordpress-plugin-create-automatic-excerpts/) is a free and convenient plugin that lets you cut down your posts (create excerpts) automatically in Index / Home, Categories, Archive, and Search sections, without you having to provide a "more" tag each time you compose a post.

The plugin lets you format the reference to the full text of your post. You can decide the specific reference text ("Read More," "Read Full Text," etc), use CSS directions from inside the admin section of your blog and / or in your main style sheet, in order to decorate or not this reference with a border, change color, increase letter spacing, etc. 

The default options have been proved satisfactory, so that most probably you can just activate and go.

Auto Limit Posts will **not** include the *rel=nofollow* tag in reference links.  NoFollow may have a negative impact for the popularity of a page, and I don't see why a blog should give a NoFollow direction concerning its main page addresses.

Auto Limit Posts can cut a post after an exact number of letters, or at the end of a word that is close to that number of letters, or at the end of the first paragraph. HTML tags you may have in your post (image tags, link tags, etc) can be stripped automatically to prevent the braking of your page. Shortcodes too can be automatically removed. A sharing option is also available.

You can see live how the plugin works (in this case limiting by word) at the web site of [Live Desktop Gadgets](http://windowslivegadgets.com/gallery/) where Auto Limit Posts is used to link home / archive excerpts to screenshots and downloads included in the main page / full text of each post.

== Installation ==
